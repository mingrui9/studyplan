\title{Calculate Sample Size for ANCOVA}
\usage{
calculate_sample_size(alpha, power, effect_size_d, r_squared)
}
\arguments{
\item{alpha}{The significance level, typically 0.05.}

\item{power}{The desired statistical power, e.g., 0.8 for 80\%.}

\item{effect_size_d}{The standardized effect size (Cohen's d) you wish to detect.}

\item{r_squared}{The proportion of variance in the outcome explained by the covariates.}
}
\value{
The required sample size per group.
}
\description{
This function calculates the required sample size per group for a two-sample
comparison with a continuous outcome, adjusting for covariates.
}
\examples{
calculate_sample_size(alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, effect_size_d = 0.5, r_squared = 0.2)
