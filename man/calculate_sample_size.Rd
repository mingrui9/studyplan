\title{Calculate Required Sample Size for a Clinical Trial}
\usage{
calculate_sample_size(power, alpha, effect_size_d, r_squared)
}
\arguments{
\item{power}{The desired statistical power (e.g., 0.90 for 90\%).}

\item{alpha}{The significance level (e.g., 0.05).}

\item{effect_size_d}{The standardized effect size (Cohen's d).}

\item{r_squared}{The expected $R^2$ value from the ANCOVA model, representing the
proportion of variance explained by covariates.}
}
\value{
The required sample size per group (rounded up to the nearest integer).
}
\description{
This function calculates the required sample size per group for a two-sample
comparison (e.g., a t-test or ANCOVA) to achieve a desired level of statistical power.
The formula adjusts for the variance explained by covariates ($R^2$).
}
\examples{
# Calculate sample size for 90\% power, 0.54 SD effect, and R^2=0.05
calculate_sample_size(
  power = 0.90,
  alpha = 0.05,
  effect_size_d = 0.54,
  r_squared = 0.05
